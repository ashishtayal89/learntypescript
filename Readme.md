# Basic typescript concepts

## Setup and run

1. `npm install typescript`
2. `tsc` <filename> Eg tsc inference.ts

## Benefits

1. Static typed code.
2. Organizate the code. It alows us to use classes which we also introduced in ES6 but it gives us the advantage of converting the ts code writen in classes to es standards be es6 ie es3,5
3. Better tooling/IDE support.
